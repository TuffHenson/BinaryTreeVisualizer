# BinaryTreeVisualizer
 A helpful way to display your binary trees!

 ## Description
This project's goal is to create a tool for displaying any binary tree structure to a console window. In order to promote simplicity, this project will display the output in the console. Since there is no standard tree library in C++, some conventions for naming and implementation will be necessary to make use of this tool. A detailed list will be included later in this document. This project is being done entirely to help programmers who are struggling with seeing their binary trees during testing, so it isn't meant to be flashy or overly complex. Just a simple tool for a simple application. Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions about how to use this program!

## How to use
This project is intended for use with C++11, so keep that in mind when running it. 
It is useable in any C++ program that adheres to the naming and implementation conventions listed below.
All you have to do is download the BinaryTreeVisualizer.h file and follow the steps.

#### Naming Conventions
These will be decided as the program is written, but stick to them or this program won't work

#### Functions and Parameters
This section will also be created as the program is created, make sure to follow it
